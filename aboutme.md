I'm Michael Maguire, and I'm not familiar with pharmaceuticals or policy surrounding pharmaecuticals (though I'm learning).

- I do, however, enjoy munging data.
- I love to automate things. If it can go in a function or a macro, don't question -- the computer is going to do it for me.
- I want to build a programming language bridge for graduate students that know other languages.
- I am decent at deciphering the hieroglyphics of programming documentation, but even I stumble sometimes. I want to make things simpler for you all.
- I love making pretty graphs. We can talk numbers, we can show frequency tables and averages, but graphs are much better at encapsulating the information you need to convey.
- I am not the best at reading other people's code. Please be patient with me. 
- Forgot to mention -- I work for Dr. Amie Goodin and Dr. Juan Hincapie-Castillo.
- I'm physically in my office (HPNP 2330) M - F from 8 - 4:30 p.m.

### My story (TLDR: I love my job and found it unexpectedly).

I was born in Gainesville, FL in 1991. I went to Littlewood Elementary School, Westwood Middle School, and Gainesville High School. I have a reputation around town of being a great baseball player until I totally lost interest **and** plateaued in skill around the age of 15. 

I went to Florida State University for my undergraduate degree in Criminology, but my minor in Philosophy proved to be the real engine for my growth as a data analyst -- Symbolic Logic, a course taught by a Professor from Oxford (Oxford and FSU philosophy have a strong connection, apparently) was the first sign that I loved learning the material and laws that provide a foundation for our daily statements and claims. I asked many professors to get into research as an undergraduate, but they never quite seemed interested or would give me the cold shoulder, so I continued living in the dark about statistical programming languages.

I took a couple years off between 2013 and 2015 to work for a former employer here in Gainesville and prepare for graduate school. Set on becoming a police officer after my master's, I trekked to Tallahassee again to begin the two-year master's program from 2015-2017. It was here where I was first introduced to statistics with actual programming languages. I felt oddly giddy playing with these softwares even though I didn't really know what was going on. Stata was the first programming language that I was introduced to, but I never really understood what I was doing -- **my professor told us to just plug these commands into the console window**. That wasn't enough for me.

I went on to take courses in Multiple Regression and Causal Analysis, both of which were largely reserved for PhD students, but I found a way to get in somehow. Again, more Stata, and more **entering straight into the console**. I couldn't get what was going on behind the scenes -- I'd never even actually viewed a data set in the data viewer in my three or so courses where we used Stata!

It was 2017, and I somehow hooked a job at the Department of Juvenile Justice in the Research and Data Integrity department as a part-time employee as I was literally sealing up papers to go to the Law Enforcement Academy. This was such a special moment, and I couldn't have possibly known what was coming. 

I became a full time employee in a couple months. We used SPSS there, and I was absolutely blown away when I had no option but to see a data set. It was truly mind-blowing being able to witness the transformations you made as opposed to **just seeing a command entered into the console**. I endured the throes of learning how to compute variables, make merges (the department valued merges as a huge task and accomplishment), and even got into my first string parsing. My love for macros began here due to some incredibly inefficient processes that were in place from my predecessors. I was one of the individuals in the department tasked with replicating a report that had been outsourced for years to a private company that involved cleaning and joining data sets from various agencies to determine recidivism for juveniles in the juvenile justice system. The individuals at DJJ impacted me more than I knew, and I am forever grateful for them.

I felt a ceiling, though, and I went to work fo the Department of Education in the School Grades department around 2019. My time there was short, but I was introduced to SAS and the complexity of the school system. The complexities called for more macros, further etching my need to automate everything that would benefit from such automation. 

Tallahassee was growing old on me, and I saw an opportunity come up at the UF College of Pharmacy, Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy. Quite literally convinced I would not get it (in fact, over lunch (Moe's) with my best friend in Tallahassee, I claimed that there's "absolutely no chance I'll get hired, but whatever"), I just kept plugging away doing data analysis during my own time and learning R -- something I had been learning on the side since I first started working at DJJ. Unexpectedly, I got an email from a Dr. Amie Goodin and a Dr. Hincapie-Castillo to come meet in Gainesville on Monday for an interview. Quite shocked, I texted my friend to meet for lunch (Moe's, again -- it was our place). I was a nervous wreck, repeating the same exact verbiage I mentioned earlier ("no way I'll get it", "what do I even know about pharmacy -- ABSOLUTELY NOTHING", "they've probably got someone internal already" -- all the usual stuff). He reassured me that I'd be good, and that I was capable of handling it if they wanted me to interview. Well, COVID-19 hit, and Dr. Amie Goodin sent me an email that the interview would now be done over -- guess what -- Zoom. Everyone's favorite 2020/2021 platform. 

The rest is history. I don't know why they picked me, but I am so excited to be here. I am so excited to learn and be surrounded with such amazing faculty, staff, and graduate students. Everyone I encounter here is amazing in their own way, and I am honored to be a part of your experience here.

**My job is to make your life easier.**

**I want to make sure that none of you go through what I went through learning statistical programming lanaguages.**

**I want you to feel comfortable working with data.**

**PLEASE see me if you have an issue, and even if I can't solve it and someone else solves it, I need to know how to figure it out myself -- you won't be the last one having the issue, I'm sure.**

**I will let you know if I am busy with something else. Don't ever feel like you're pestering me, PLEASE!**
