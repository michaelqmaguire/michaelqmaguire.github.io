I'm Michael Maguire, and I'm a data analyst in The Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy.

- I believe in providing short, quick solutions instead of long, drawn-out posts about every facet of a given function.
- I work for Dr. Amie Goodin and Dr. Juan Hincapie-Castillo.
- I'm physically in my office (HPNP 2330) M - F from 8 - 4:30 p.m.

I attended Florida State University for my undergraduate (2010 - 2013) and graduate (2015 - 2017) degrees. I have roughly five years of experience conducting data analysis and data management. I have previously worked for the Florida Department of Juvenile Justice and the Florida Department of Education.

I have experience using the following languages:

- R (intermediate/advanced)
- SAS (advanced)
- SPSS (intermediate)
- Stata (beginner)
