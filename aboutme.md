I'm Michael Maguire, and I'm a data analyst in The Department of Pharmaceutical Outcomes and Policy at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy.

- I love/hate cleaning data.
- I love to automate things. If it can go in a function or a macro, don't question -- the computer is going to do it for me.
- I want to build a programming language bridge for graduate students that know other languages.
- I am decent at deciphering the hieroglyphics of programming documentation, but even I stumble sometimes. I want to make things simpler for you all.
- I am a bit obsessive about organized code. I have developed conventions that may look odd at first sight, but it helps keep things organized and consistent across scripts/programs.
- I love making pretty graphs. We can talk numbers, we can show frequency tables and averages, but graphs are much better at encapsulating the information you need to convey.
- I am not the best at reading other people's code. Please be patient with me. 
- Forgot to mention -- I work for Dr. Amie Goodin and Dr. Juan Hincapie-Castillo.
- I'm physically in my office (HPNP 2330) M - F from 8 - 4:30 p.m.

I was born in Gainesville, FL in 1991.

I went to Florida State University for my undergraduate degree in Criminology, but my minor in Philosophy proved to be the real engine for my growth as a data analyst -- Symbolic Logic, a course taught by a Professor from Oxford (Oxford and FSU philosophy have a strong connection, apparently) was the first sign that I loved learning the material and laws that provide a foundation for practically all programming languages. I also have a master's degree in Criminology from Florida State University.

I have experience using the following languages:

- R (intermediate)
- SAS (advanced)
- SPSS (intermediate)
- Stata (beginner)
